   * Functions that manage a combinate idbVersion, by combining the current time
   * in millis that represents user migrations with a large multiplier that
   * represents PouchDB system migrations.
   *
   * This lets us use the idb version number to both represent internal PouchDB
   * migrations as well as user migrations required for adding / removing
   * indexes etc.
   *
   * Given that Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9007199254740991
   *
   * We can easily use the largest 2-3 digits and either allow:
   *  - 900 system migrations up to 2198/02/18
   *  - or 89 system migrations up to 5050/02/14
   *
   * This impl does the former.
   *
   * This could be smarter, as we could open the DB, work out the current
   * version and then close and reopen with version+1, but this is simpler.
